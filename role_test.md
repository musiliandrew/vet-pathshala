# Role Selection Testing Guide

## Testing the Fixed Role Selection

### Problem Identified:
- Role selection only worked for NEW users
- Existing users kept their original role even when selecting a different role during sign-in
- Role wasn't being updated in Firestore for existing users

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Added debug logging** to track role flow through the app
2. **Added role update logic** for existing users in auth service  
3. **Added user data refresh** after role update

### Testing Steps:

#### Test 1: New User Registration (Should work as before)
1. Use a completely new email/Google account
2. Select "Farmer" role during registration
3. Complete sign-up process
4. **Expected**: Should see farmer home screen with farm-specific UI

#### Test 2: Existing User Role Change (Fixed)
1. Sign out of current account
2. Sign in with existing account but select "Farmer" role
3. **Expected**: Should now see farmer home screen instead of veterinary screen

### Debug Output to Look For:
```
ðŸš€ AuthService: Role parameter received = "farmer"
ðŸš€ AuthService: Final role being saved = "farmer"
ðŸš€ _updateUserRole: Updating user [uid] to role "farmer"
âœ… _updateUserRole: Role updated successfully in Firestore
ðŸš€ UnifiedHomeScreen: Current user role = "farmer"
âœ… UnifiedHomeScreen: Showing FarmerHomeScreen
```

### Farmer Home Screen Features:
- Welcome message with farm name
- Animal summary cards (cows, buffalo, dogs, goats, sheep)
- Urgent alerts with red pulsing border
- Daily milk production tracking
- Farm diary entries
- Coin rewards center

The role selection should now work correctly for both new and existing users!
