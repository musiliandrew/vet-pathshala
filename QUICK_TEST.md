# 🚜 QUICK FARMER TEST

## Simple Test to Verify Role Change:

After you sign in as farmer and see the console messages showing the role was updated to "farmer", try this:

### **1. Refresh the Page**
- Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R` to refresh the browser
- The app should maintain your login but now pick up the farmer role

### **2. Check Console**
After refresh, you should see:
```
🚀 UnifiedHomeScreen: Current user role = "farmer"
✅ UnifiedHomeScreen: Showing FarmerHomeScreen  
🚜 FarmerHomeScreen: Building farmer home screen
🚜 MainApp: Building farmer-specific navigation
```

### **3. Visual Check**
You should see:
- **Green app bar**: "🚜 FARMER MODE ACTIVE 🌾"
- **Green background** instead of white
- **Emoji navigation**: 🏠📖💊📁👤 at bottom

If this works after a refresh, then the issue is just that the UI isn't auto-refreshing after role change. We can fix that next!

Try the refresh and let me know what you see! 🌾
